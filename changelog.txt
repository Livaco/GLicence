1.3 Changelog:
- Added protection for buying without sufficent funds. Sorry for the wait, only realised after a support ticket came through about it.
- Added a few bLogs options.
- Changed the way the files look. Less spacing, keep consistent with my other recent addons.
- Moved all core files into the two main files (sv_main and cl_main), instead of all other files. Saves the server loading them all.

Enjoy!
